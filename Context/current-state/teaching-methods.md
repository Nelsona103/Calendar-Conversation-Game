# Teaching Methods & Instructional Strategies

## Core Instructional Approach

### Primary Teaching Model
- **Foundation**: Gradual Release (I do, We do, You do)
- **Lesson Structure**:
  - **10-20 minutes**: Focused instruction and modeling
  - **Minimum 25 minutes**: Exploration, practice, and learning application
  - **Emphasis**: Curiosity-driven discovery rather than rote practice
- **Daily Language Goals**: Students engage in reading, writing, listening, and speaking every day

### Classroom Philosophy
- **Structure with Flexibility**: Balance organization with social skill development
- **Productive Conversation**: Encouraged rather than rigid silence
- **Dual Purpose**: Space for both academic and social growth
- **Student Perception**: Described as "cool," welcoming, caring, and serious about learning
- **Cultural Integration**: Actively incorporate Mexican and Hmong cultures as learning assets

## Language Development Approaches

### Scaffolded Language Instruction
- **I Do, We Do, You Do**: Gradual release of responsibility model
- **Think-Alouds**: Modeling academic language and thinking processes
- **Sentence Frames**: Structured support for oral and written expression
- **Visual Supports**: Graphic organizers, charts, and imagery

### Culturally Responsive Teaching
- **Asset-Based Mindset**: Building on students' home languages and cultures
- **Cultural Connections**: Linking new content to familiar experiences
- **Community Knowledge**: Incorporating students' backgrounds into curriculum
- **Identity Affirmation**: Celebrating multilingual identities

## Assessment Framework

### Grade Categories
1. **Classwork**: 25% (daily engagement and participation)
2. **Tests**: 50% (formal assessments and quizzes)
3. **Reading Progress**: 25% (Microsoft Teams Reading Progress fluency metrics)

### Data Collection Methods
**Formative Assessment**
- Daily warmup multiple choice quizzes (standards-aligned)
- Exit tickets for lesson closure and comprehension checks
- Claude-generated question banks (weekly batches for consistency)

**Fluency Metrics (Reading Progress)**
- **Automated Tracking**: Mispronounced words, words per minute, omissions, insertions
- **Individual Progress**: Student pacing through decodable reader sequences
- **Efficiency**: Reduces teacher time while providing detailed data

### Current Assessment Challenges
**Primary Pain Point**: Writing assessment
- Time-consuming evaluation process
- Difficulty identifying patterns across student work
- Need for efficient skill gap identification systems

**Progress Monitoring Needs**
- System for identifying collective skill gaps across classes
- Individual student needs assessment automation
- More efficient methods for writing evaluation and feedback

## Group-Specific Strategies

### ELD Advanced
**ELPAC Integration Strategy**
- **Summit K12 Usage**: Target 1.5 hours per week for standardized test practice
- **Primary Challenge**: Balancing test preparation with engagement activities
- **Innovation Need**: Weekly interactive language development games/apps
- **Instructional Flexibility**: Lesson structure varies based on student needs and energy

**Engagement Focus**
- Recognition of potential unidentified learning disabilities requiring diagnostic support
- Strength-based activities that build on existing cultural and linguistic knowledge
- Need for tools that break through learning plateaus and re-engage frustrated learners
- Focus on academic language development through culturally relevant content

### ELA 7 Language Intensive Focus
**Structured Daily Routine**
1. **Warmup**: Multiple choice quizzes (standards-aligned)
2. **Focused Lesson**: 10-20 minutes of direct instruction
3. **Extended Practice**: 25+ minutes of exploration and application
4. **Exit Tickets**: Formative assessment and lesson closure

**Materials and Resources**
- **Question Banks**: Claude-generated weekly batches for consistency
- **Reclassification Focus**: Success measured by students exiting ELL status
- **Academic Language**: Intensive development of formal registers
- **Benchmark Progress**: Close-to-reclassification students requiring accelerated support

### ELD Beginners/Intermediate
**Daily Foundation Building**
- **Morning Start**: 2 decodable readers on Microsoft Teams Reading Progress
- **Phonics Focus**: Specific blends, digraphs, and sound patterns
- **Fluency Development**: Systematic progression through reading levels

**Differentiation Reality**
- **Range Challenge**: Supporting alphabet learners alongside intermediate students
- **Classroom Constraint**: Only one teacher for vast proficiency spread
- **Best Practice**: Separate group work when possible
- **Current Population**: All Spanish-speaking students

**Reading Progress Integration**
- Automated fluency tracking and metrics
- Individual pacing through decodable reader sequences
- Data collection on pronunciation, speed, and accuracy

## Technology Integration Strategies

### Blended Learning Approach
- **Online Practice**: Reinforcement of classroom learning
- **Digital Creation**: Students producing content, not just consuming
- **Collaborative Tools**: Online spaces for peer interaction
- **Progress Tracking**: Digital portfolios and goal monitoring

### Engagement Techniques
- **Gamification**: Point systems, badges, and friendly competition
- **Interactive Content**: Clickable, explorable learning materials
- **Choice and Voice**: Student input in tool selection and use
- **Real-World Connections**: Authentic tasks and audiences

## Differentiation by Language Proficiency

### Beginning Level Adaptations
- **Visual Heavy**: Minimal text, maximum imagery
- **Repetition Cycles**: Same content, multiple exposures
- **Concrete Examples**: Abstract concepts made tangible
- **Native Language Support**: Strategic use of home languages

### Intermediate Level Strategies
- **Sentence Starters**: Academic language frames
- **Collaborative Support**: Peer partnerships for language practice
- **Process Scaffolding**: Step-by-step guidance for complex tasks
- **Error Tolerance**: Focus on communication over perfection

### Advanced Level Challenges
- **Complex Thinking**: Higher-order thinking skill development
- **Academic Discourse**: Formal presentation and discussion skills
- **Independent Research**: Self-directed learning projects
- **Critical Analysis**: Evaluation and synthesis tasks

## Standards Alignment & Innovation

### Current Standards Framework
- **Foundation**: Common Core State Standards (California)
- **Philosophy**: Believe in age-appropriate skill progression
- **Innovation Perspective**: Standards need updates for "new age skills"
- **Future Vision**: Include prompting and context engineering skills in curriculum

### Cultural Responsiveness Integration
- **Active Incorporation**: Mexican and Hmong cultural elements in lessons
- **Asset-Based Approach**: View cultural integration as growth opportunity
- **Language Honoring**: Seek ways to value and build on home languages
- **Community Connection**: Build bridges between school and cultural communities

This comprehensive methodology framework guides all instructional decisions, assessment practices, and educational technology development priorities.
