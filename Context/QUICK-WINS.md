### Step 3: Notice the Difference
- **Before**: Generic suggestions that don't fit your classroom
- **After**: Solutions that work for Spanish/Hmong ELLs on Chromebooks

## üî• **Your Biggest Time Wasters ‚Üí Context Solutions**

### Problem: "I spend 3 hours every week creating different versions of the same worksheet"
**Context Solution**:
```
"Using my student demographics and teaching methods context, create 3 versions of [topic] - one for alphabet learners, one for intermediate, one for advanced ELD students. Follow my gradual release model."
```
**Result**: 20 minutes instead of 3 hours

### Problem: "AI gives me generic React app ideas that don't work in my classroom"
**Context Solution**:
```
"Reference my react-app-template.md and student-demographics.md. Build an interactive [skill] game that works on low-end Chromebooks for my ELD Advanced students who need engagement."
```
**Result**: Apps that actually work with your students

### Problem: "I re-explain my classroom situation every time I talk to AI"
**Context Solution**:
```
"Load my context from .context/quick-reference.md. Now help me with [task]."
```
**Result**: AI already knows your 130 ELLs, 7 bell schedules, FERPA needs

### Problem: "Parent communication takes forever and often fails due to language barriers"
**Context Solution**:
```
"Using my parent-communication-template.md, create a weekly progress message about [topic] that works for Spanish-speaking families via text."
```
**Result**: Clear, culturally appropriate communication

### Problem: "I want to innovate but don't know where to focus my limited time"
**Context Solution**:
```
"Review my current-ai-workflows.md pain points and future-goals.md priorities. What's the highest-impact tool I should build next?"
```
**Result**: Strategic focus on what matters most

## ‚ö° **One-Week Efficiency Test**

### Monday: Load Context Once
Use this prompt: "Please read .context/quick-reference.md to understand my teaching context."

### Tuesday-Friday: Just Reference
Use this format: "Based on my teaching context, help me [specific task]."
