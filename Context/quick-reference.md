# Quick Reference Guide

## Who I Am
- **Role**: Middle School TSA supporting 130 ELLs in California (Fresno area)
- **Teaching Load**: 3 classes - ELD Advanced, ELA 7 LIF, ELD Beginners/Intermediate
- **Student Population**: Spanish-speaking (majority) and Hmong students, ages 12-14
- **Innovation Focus**: Building AI-powered educational tools for language learning
- **Mission**: Serving community through youth development, honoring cultural foundations

## My Immediate Needs

### Current Workflow Priorities
1. **Interactive language games for ELD Advanced** - break through ELPAC plateau with weekly React apps
2. **Differentiation system for Beginners/Intermediate** - serve alphabet learners and intermediates simultaneously
3. **Writing assessment automation** - pattern recognition and efficient evaluation
4. **Parent communication streamlining** - multilingual family engagement system
5. **FERPA-compliant AI integration** - safe student-AI interaction process

### Specific Tool Requests
- Weekly React apps with competition/scoring elements
- Automated content generation for multiple proficiency levels
- Assessment analysis that identifies collective skill gaps
- Multilingual parent progress reports
- Student prompt vetting system for AI access

## My Students (The Priority)

### Demographics & Range
- **Ages**: 12-14 years old (middle school)
- **Proficiency Span**: Alphabet learning â†’ near-reclassification
- **Languages**: Spanish-speaking (majority from Mexico), significant Hmong population
- **Engagement Needs**: Agency, relevance, games, competition, social learning

### What Motivates Them
- Activities with personal relevance and clear value
- Student choice and voice in learning
- Interactive games and friendly competition
- Social collaboration and peer interaction
- Tools that give them confidence and leadership opportunities

### What Disengages Them
- Tasks without clear purpose ("just something we're supposed to do")
- Content too difficult without support scaffolding
- Lack of connection to their lives and interests
- Extended individual work without variety

## Technical Context

### Current Skills & Tools
- **Comfortable with**: React development, VS Code, Claude Code terminal
- **Building**: Custom educational React apps for classroom use
- **Using**: Claude Projects for standards-aligned content generation
- **Learning**: Machine learning concepts, Spanish language, advanced programming
- **Available**: MS Teams Reading Progress, Summit K12, district Chromebooks

### Development Constraints
- **Student Devices**: Low-end Chromebooks with limited processing power
- **Class Time**: 48-56 minute periods (7 different bell schedules)
- **AI Access**: No direct student access due to age restrictions
- **District Pace**: Large bureaucracy = slow institutional change
- **Family Engagement**: Low due to language barriers, using text translation

## Success Indicators

### Student Transformation (Primary)
- Students gaining confidence and using voice courageously
- High engagement through interactive, culturally relevant tools
- Making friends easily and becoming campus leaders
- Clear, confident conversations with adults

### Academic Metrics (Secondary)
- Increased reclassification rates for ELL students
- Measurable engagement through tool usage
- Portfolio of reusable educational React apps
- 50% reduction in planning time through AI workflows

### Professional Goals
- Launch edtech consulting business within 1 year
- Scale innovations to support other teachers
- Position as "light for innovation" in education

## Project Development Priorities

### Must-Have Features (Non-Negotiable)
1. **Engaging & Game-Like**: Fun-focused approach that masks learning
2. **Chromebook Compatible**: Works on low-end student devices
3. **Multi-Level Support**: Serves different proficiency levels
4. **Data Collection**: Provides assessment and progress information
5. **Student Agency**: Offers choice and voice in learning

### Quality Standards
- **Culturally Responsive**: Honors Mexican and Hmong backgrounds
- **FERPA Compliant**: Protects student privacy completely
- **Teacher Sustainable**: Can be maintained without IT support
- **Scalable Design**: Could be shared with other educators

## Communication Preferences

### Approach Style
- **Direct & Practical**: Efficiency and automation-focused solutions
- **Educational Context**: Technical depth connected to pedagogy
- **Measured Impact**: Focus on student outcomes and data-driven results
- **Scalability Mindset**: Consider how solutions could help other teachers

### Collaboration Notes
- Prioritize student engagement and ELL accessibility
- Work within real constraints (time, devices, district policies)
- Honor cultural assets and multilingual strengths
- Balance innovation with proven educational practices

## Emergency Context Script
*For rapid AI context setting:*

```
"I'm a TSA supporting 130+ ELLs with 3 classes:
- ELD Advanced (ELPAC plateau, need engagement)
- ELA 7 LIF (near reclassification, working well with Claude Projects)
- Beginners/Intermediate (alphabet to intermediate, extreme differentiation)

Building React apps for language learning, need FERPA-compliant tools
that work on student Chromebooks and serve my Spanish/Hmong population.

Current need: [specific challenge]"
```

## Key Reminders for AI Assistants
- Every solution should prioritize student engagement and cultural responsiveness
- Work within real classroom constraints (devices, time, policies)
- Focus on tools that enhance rather than replace human connection
- Consider scalability for other teachers facing similar challenges
- Always maintain FERPA compliance and student privacy protection
