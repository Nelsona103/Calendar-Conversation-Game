# Continuous Reflection System

*A structured approach to surfacing blind spots and driving growth*

## The EXAMINE Framework

### E - Evidence Collection
**Weekly Task**: Document without judgment
- What actually happened (not what you planned)
- Who spoke most/least in your classes
- Where you spent your time
- Which students you thought about outside class
- What resources you actually used vs. created

### X - eXternal Perspectives
**Bi-weekly Task**: Seek outside views
- Ask a student: "What's one thing I don't understand about being in my class?"
- Ask a colleague: "What's my teaching blind spot?"
- Ask a parent: "What does your child say about my class at home?"
- Ask AI: "Based on this week's data, what patterns do I miss?"

### A - Assumption Hunting
**Monthly Task**: Identify hidden beliefs
- Complete: "Good students always..."
- Complete: "Struggling students need..."
- Complete: "Learning happens when..."
- Complete: "Technology should..."
- Review these statements for bias

### M - Mirror Moments
**Monthly Task**: See yourself clearly
- Record yourself teaching for 10 minutes
- Tally: Who do you call on? Who do you praise? Who do you correct?
- Note: Your body language with different students
- Track: Your energy levels during different activities

### I - Impact Investigation
**Quarterly Task**: Measure what matters
- Survey students anonymously: "What did you really learn?"
- Check in with last year's students: "What stuck?"
- Interview families: "How has English learning affected home life?"
- Analyze: Gap between your intentions and actual impact

### N - New Lens Application
**Quarterly Task**: Try a different framework
- Q1: View your teaching through anti-racist lens
- Q2: View your teaching through neurodiversity lens
- Q3: View your teaching through trauma-informed lens
- Q4: View your teaching through indigenous pedagogy lens

### E - Evolution Documentation
**Semester Task**: Track your changes
- Compare your current practice to 6 months ago
- What beliefs have shifted? Why?
- What practices have you abandoned? Added?
- What questions are you asking now that you weren't before?

## Daily Micro-Reflections (2 minutes)

### Morning Intention
"What assumption will I challenge today?"

### Midday Check
"Who haven't I noticed yet today?"

### End of Day
"What made me uncomfortable today? That's my growth edge."

## The Uncomfortable Growth Protocol

### When You Feel Defensive
1. **Pause**: That's your growth alarm
2. **Get Curious**: "Why does this threaten me?"
3. **Dig Deeper**: "What identity am I protecting?"
4. **Find Truth**: "What's 10% true about this criticism?"
5. **Take Action**: Make one small change

### When You Feel Certain
1. **Red Flag**: Certainty blocks learning
2. **Seek Opposition**: Find credible disagreement
3. **Steel-man**: Make the strongest counter-argument
4. **Find Middle**: What third option exists?
5. **Stay Humble**: Add "I currently believe..."

### When You Feel Successful
1. **Look Closer**: Success for whom?
2. **Check Margins**: Who didn't succeed?
3. **Question Metrics**: What are you not measuring?
4. **Seek Critique**: Ask someone to challenge this success
5. **Stay Hungry**: How could this be better?

## Creating Your Personal Board of Directors

Assemble an informal "board" for your practice:
1. **The Challenger**: Someone who respectfully disagrees with your approach
2. **The Elder**: Experienced educator with different philosophy
3. **The Novice**: New teacher with fresh eyes
4. **The Student**: Former student who can be honest
5. **The Parent**: Family member who offers parent perspective
6. **The Critical Friend**: Colleague who supports but questions
7. **The Outsider**: Non-educator who asks naive but powerful questions

## Blind Spot Detection Partners

### Partner Observation Protocol
- Monthly classroom visits
- Focus on one blind spot area
- Use structured observation tool
- Debrief with curious questions, not advice

### Video Review Club
- Record monthly lesson
- Watch each other's videos
- Look for patterns teacher doesn't see
- Ask "What else could explain this?"

### Data Analysis Partner
- Share assessment data
- Look for patterns you might miss
- Question your interpretations
- Suggest alternative explanations

## The Growth Documentation System

### Keep a "Blind Spot Journal"
- Date discovered
- How it was revealed
- Initial resistance/reaction
- Steps taken to address
- Evidence of growth
- Remaining work needed

### Maintain a "Failure Resume"
- What failed
- Why it failed
- What you learned
- How you changed
- What you'd do differently

### Create an "Assumption Graveyard"
- Beliefs you've abandoned
- Why you held them
- What changed your mind
- What replaced them
- What you learned about yourself

## Making This Sustainable

### Start Small
- Choose ONE protocol
- Practice for a month
- Add another only when first is habit

### Automate Reminders
- Calendar weekly prompts
- Set phone alerts for micro-reflections
- Create templates for quick capture

### Find Accountability
- Share system with colleague
- Report monthly to partner
- Celebrate growth together

### Track Impact
- Document how reflections change practice
- Note student outcome improvements
- Collect evidence of growth

## Remember

- **Blind spots are not weaknesses** - they're human
- **Discovery requires courage** - lean into discomfort
- **Growth is not linear** - expect setbacks
- **Perfect teachers don't exist** - aim for conscious improvement
- **Your students deserve your growth** - this work matters
