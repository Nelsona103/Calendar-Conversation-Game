# AI Enhancement Prompts for Critical Thinking

*Use these prompts with AI to enhance your thinking, not replace it*

## Perspective-Challenging Prompts

### The Devil's Advocate Prompt
"I'm about to share my approach to [teaching method/innovation]. Please argue against it from three perspectives: a traditional educator, a critical pedagogy theorist, and a student who struggles with this approach. Help me see what I might be missing."

### The Hidden Harm Prompt
"Here's something I'm doing that I think is helpful: [describe practice]. What potential unintended negative consequences might I not be seeing? Consider academic, social, emotional, and cultural impacts."

### The Assumption Revealer
"I believe [state belief about education/students]. What assumptions underlie this belief? What evidence would challenge it? What would someone from a completely different cultural or educational background say?"

## Decision Enhancement Prompts

### The Pre-Mortem
"I'm planning to [implement new strategy/tool]. Imagine it's one year from now and this has completely failed. What went wrong? What warning signs did I miss?"

### The Value Interrogator
"I'm excited about [new tool/method] because [reasons]. What values are driving this excitement? Are these values aligned with my students' needs or my own preferences? What values might I be neglecting?"

### The Equity Auditor
"Analyze this [lesson plan/tool/strategy] for equity issues. Who might be advantaged or disadvantaged? Consider language, culture, economics, ability, technology access, and learning styles."

## Reflection Deepening Prompts

### The Pattern Finder
"Here are my last five [successes/failures/decisions]: [list them]. What patterns do you notice about my thinking? What might these patterns reveal about my blind spots?"

### The Student Voice Simulator
"Based on what I've told you about my students, channel the perspective of: a shy Hmong girl, a confident Spanish-speaking boy, a long-term ELL who hates the label, a newcomer overwhelmed by everything. How would each experience [my lesson/innovation]?"

### The Time Traveler
"It's 2035. My current 7th graders are 25. Looking back, what aspects of my 2025 teaching will they value most? What will seem outdated or harmful? What skills do they wish I'd taught them?"

## Bias Detection Prompts

### The Attention Tracker
"Here's how I spent my time this week: [describe]. Which students or types of students am I unconsciously prioritizing? What patterns suggest bias in my attention distribution?"

### The Success Story Analyzer
"My favorite success stories are: [share 3-5 stories]. What do these stories reveal about my definition of success? Whose stories am I not telling? What successes am I not seeing?"

### The Language Auditor
"Here's how I described a challenge with my students: [paste description]. Analyze my language for deficit thinking, cultural bias, or hidden assumptions about students and families."

## System Thinking Prompts

### The Zoom Out
"I'm focused on solving [specific problem]. Help me zoom out - what larger systems contribute to this problem? What would need to change beyond my classroom for a real solution?"

### The Paradox Explorer
"I want my students to be both [value 1] and [value 2]. These might be in tension. How can I hold both? When do they conflict? What third option might transcend this binary?"

### The Unintended Systems
"I've created [system/workflow/tool]. What invisible systems might this create? How might students/teachers game this system? What behaviors am I unintentionally incentivizing?"

## Innovation Critique Prompts

### The Luddite's Wisdom
"Make the strongest case against using [technology/AI tool] in education. What wisdom might exist in the 'old ways'? What human elements can't be replicated?"

### The Complexity Assessor
"I want to implement [innovation]. Is this adding essential complexity or complicating something that should be simple? What's the simplest possible solution I'm overlooking?"

### The ROI Calculator
"I spend [X hours] on [innovation/tool]. Calculate the real ROI in terms of student learning (not engagement). What else could I do with that time? Be brutally honest."

## Growth Edge Prompts

### The Discomfort Locator
"Based on our conversation, what topic or suggestion made me most defensive or dismissive? That's likely where my biggest growth opportunity lies. Explore why this triggers me."

### The Expertise Trap
"Where might my growing expertise in [area] actually limit my effectiveness? How might beginner's mind serve my students better in some situations?"

### The Identity Challenger
"I see myself as an innovative, tech-forward educator. How might this identity constrain me? What would I do differently if I didn't need to maintain this image?"

## Weekly Reflection Protocol

### Monday Morning
"What am I assuming will happen this week? What if the opposite were true?"

### Wednesday Check-in
"What have I noticed but not really SEEN this week? What merits deeper attention?"

### Friday Review
"What questions did my students ask that I dismissed too quickly? What were they really asking?"

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Choose one prompt per week** - depth over breadth
2. **Write your initial response** before asking AI
3. **Ask AI the prompt** with your specific context
4. **Journal the difference** between your answer and AI's
5. **Identify one action** to take based on insights
6. **Return to challenging prompts** quarterly

## Creating Your Own Prompts

When designing prompts to enhance your thinking:
- Start with "What if I'm wrong about..."
- Include multiple perspectives
- Ask for evidence against your position
- Request cultural perspectives you lack
- Invite complexity rather than simplification
- Focus on questions, not answers

## The Meta-Enhancement

"AI, based on my context documents and our interactions, what critical questions am I NOT asking you? What prompts would most challenge my thinking and help me grow?"

## Remember

- **AI should complicate your thinking**, not simplify it
- **Discomfort indicates growth zones** - lean into it
- **Your expertise can become your limitation** - stay humble
- **Every answer should generate new questions**
- **The goal is wisdom, not just efficiency**
