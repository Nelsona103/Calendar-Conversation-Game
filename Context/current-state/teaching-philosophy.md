## Decision-Making Framework

When evaluating new tools or approaches, ask:

1. **Does this serve my students' actual needs?** (Not what I think they need)
2. **Will this tool still be useful in six months?** (Sustainability test)
3. **Can I maintain this without becoming a full-time developer?** (Capacity check)
4. **Does this align with my core educational values?** (Mission alignment)
5. **Will this create more time for teaching, or consume it?** (Efficiency test)

This philosophy guides all educational technology decisions and tool development priorities.
